## tmux-screen-compat

This is a config for tmux that tries to make it behave like screen.

These are bindings that I use, and I believe are common for screen users with a
mostly default config.

On Mac OS X make sure you have `reattach-to-user-namespace` installed, you can
install it from
[Nix](https://dev.to/louy2/installing-nix-on-macos-catalina-2acb) or
[brew](http://brew.sh).
